     This archive represents the file called 'ppp-2.2.0d.tar.gz' for
     Linux only.

The changes from 2.2.0c to 2.2.0d are:

1. Change chat to recognize the ABORT strings if you specify a sub-string.

2. Change the ppp.c file to prevent the symbol table compilation problems.

3. Augment the IP list in the authentication to include a netmask option
   and to permit a reject as well as the default accept entries.

4. Flushed the tty input buffer prior to starting the connect program.
   This prevents old modem responses from a previous session to be fed to
   the current one.

5. Integrated Paul Mackerras' fix for a bug in the CCP which causes
   the bsd compression to constantly re-negotiate a smaller and smaller
   code size.

6. Added options to set the Predictor-1 compressor if so desired. Predictor-1
   is used by Morningstar's PPP package.

7. Add support for Microsoft DNS parameters by Christoper Lameter.

8. Support for the IPX protocol. It originated, and substantially resembles
   since it started with, the work by G.Cambell@irl.cri.nz. Many thanks to
   him for starting and getting the initial code to work. The IPX support
   requires at least the 1.3.43 kernel.

The changes from 2.2.0b to 2.2.0c are:

1. Correct the reference in the ppp.c file for the definition of the
   symbol table. This is used if you not using modules.

There is still a compile/link problem with the a.out format. The problem
is not with ppp, but in the module.h header file. If you are using a.out
and have problems linking with an unresolved 'mod_use_count_' then use
the following patch on the /usr/include/linux/module.h header file.

ELF does not have this problem. Only a.out will complain.

The changes from 2.2.0a to 2.2.0b are:

1. Correct a problem with the 1.3.33+ kernels in that they would cause
   a SIGSEGV should you run the pppd program with the 'defaultroute'
   option.

2. Corrections in the ppp.c driver for non-module builds regarding the
   symbol version informaiton.

3. Removed bad definitions of the MOD_INC_USE_COUNT and MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT
   from ppp.c.

4. Corrected the cleanup logic for the device. The test for ppp_alive
   was the wrong sense.

5. Corrected the references in chat scripts for "/usr/lib/ppp" to be
   "/usr/sbin".

The changes from 2.2.0 and 2.2.0a are:

1. The code files have been moved to the /usr/sbin directory. This should
   have been done in the 2.2.0 package but something happened and an old
   Makefile was shipped in its place.

2. The BSD compressor module, bsd_comp, will ONLY compile as a loadable
   module. This was performed for a few technical reasons and one legal
   reason. (The legal reason is in the README file here.)

3. The test for the presence of ppp support has been moved to after the
   decode of the options. It means that the test will no longer use /dev/tty
   which may not be appropriate at that time.

4. The pppstats program has been changed to work with the driver since the
   driver will no longer attempt to do a floating point operation. This
   previously would cause a kernel panic.

			ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1. This distribution requires either a kernel from the 1.2 series
which is at or later than 1.2.11 or a kernel from the 1.3 series which
is at or later 1.3.34. In short, you should use the latest version
from either release. The difficulties in supporting earlier versions
as they were being developed were too great. This means that the code
may or may not work. If it does not then when you ask the answer will
be the same; UPGRADE to the latest revision of the 1.2 or 1.3 kernels!!

2. Please, please, read the README file in this directory __and__ the
README.linux file. Pay attention to the fact that you _must_ do the
command:

make kernel

This does not mean that you need to build the kernel, although you
will need to do this also, but you must do the command from the ppp
directory to make any appropriate patches.

3. Do not be concerned should the 'make kernel' say that a file is
current and not need to be replaced. It only means that the kernel
already has the proper files. To be honest, it is the reason that
there is a 'make kernel' -- to cover this condition. I had too many
people put older drivers into the kernel because they followed the
wrong set of instructions. Now, for all versions, there is only one
set of instructions -- "do make kernel".

[Ed.: After I wrote this, I received email from someone who had problems
which could not be addressed by the standard 'make kernel'. It will not
be able to make the proper changes if you have not applied the sequence
against an original then there is a version specific instruction in the
README.linux file.]
